#### An application for booking tours

```
This app is meant as practice and therefore may seem incomplete or not styled properly.
```

* Rails 5.1.6

* Ruby 2.5.0

* Devise for Admin role

* Stripe payment methods

----------

#### Rails
```
Used RoR to:
* allow the User to create events - setting max bookings, price, date of event and much more.
* create a booking when a tour is booked and paid for to better manage the data of the atendees and manipulate the data within the app easier.
```

#### Devise
```
Only changed Devise by making it a 1 User system.
```

#### Stripe
```
Configured Stripe by adding:
* dynamic pricing
* quantity of purchases
