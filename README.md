# Tour Booking Application

https://deli-tours.herokuapp.com/

#### An application for booking tours

* Rails 5.1.6

* Ruby 2.5.0

* Devise for Admin role

* Stripe payment methods

----------

#### Rails
```
Used RoR to:
* allow the User to create events - setting max bookings, price, date of event and much more.
* create a booking when a tour is booked and paid for to better manage the data of the atendees and manipulate the data within the app easier.
```

#### Devise
```
Only changed Devise by making it a 1 User system.
```

#### Stripe
```
Configured Stripe by adding:
* dynamic pricing
* quantity of purchases
* added a booking system when a purchase is made
```

#### For Practice Purposes

This app was made for practice and isn't a completed project, I realize there are major gaps in it, most noticeably the styling. I do not intend to update or finish this app any further.
